# book_analysis

This project provides analysis and exercises based on the book "Miracle in the Andes". It includes Jupyter notebooks for exploring the text, extracting insights, and performing various machine learning or natural language processing tasks.

## Project Structure

- `book_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook for book analysis.
- `miracle_in_the_andes.txt`: The book text used for analysis.
- `main.py`: Python script for diary sentiment analysis and visualization.
- `diary/`: Folder containing diary entry text files for sentiment analysis.
- `Solution/Exercise.ipynb`: Additional exercises and solutions.
- `Solution/miracle_in_the_andes.txt`: Duplicate of the book text for exercises.
- `Solution_sentiments/`: Folder with solution code and diary data for sentiment analysis exercises.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code).
3. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed (e.g., pandas, numpy, nltk, matplotlib, plotly, streamlit).

## Usage

- Run the notebooks to perform text analysis and explore the book.
- Use `main.py` to analyze and visualize diary sentiment scores.
- Modify or extend the notebooks and scripts for custom analysis.
